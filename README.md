# HDR-D3 Github Repo

This is a home page for current public scripts D3 is sharing with developers and academic communities. Data Driven Design at HDR believes that we are just a small part of a much broader mission to update the AEC industry to best be positioned for life in the world of Industry 4.0.

From using plugins and scripts to add data to Rhino models, to creating database links to be able to use store and manipulate that data, D3 believes in fully harnessing the computational power of the tools we use every day for design.

**Space planning is just one of the many ways our tools can help make an organization more efficient.**

By bringing metrics that are quantifiable to the design process we can test, analyze, and simulate performance in order to reach a better outcome for HDR's clients. We partner with talented designers within the firm to create a solution that produces measurable results.

**At D3, we are opportunists. We're platform agnostic and we're always on the search for the tools that will help drive the mission forward. Please reach out to us if you would like to find out more about how we use Data to optimize floorplans and spatial layouts.**
